Java's contents include core language concepts like data types, control statements, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), as well as advanced topics such as exception handling, collections framework, multithreading, file I/O, database connectivity (JDBC), and web frameworks. It also involves working with development tools like the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
## Primitive Data Types:
These are the fundamental building blocks and represent single, raw values. They are predefined in Java and are not considered objects.
Integer Types: Used for whole numbers.
byte: 1 byte, range -128 to 127.
short: 2 bytes, range -32,768 to 32,767.
int: 4 bytes, range -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (most commonly used).
long: 8 bytes, range -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
Floating-Point Types: Used for numbers with decimal points.
float: 4 bytes, single-precision floating-point.
double: 8 bytes, double-precision floating-point (most commonly used).
Character Type:
char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character (e.g., 'A', 'â‚¬').
Boolean Type:
boolean: Stores true or false values.
